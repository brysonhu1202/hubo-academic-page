Bo Hu received his Master's degree in Applied Psychology from Northeast Normal University, where his research focused on the problem of misinformation on the Internet and online intervention facilitation (based on inoculation theory). Now, he focuses on climate change issues in China, specifically, the current status of Chinese citizens' low-carbon lifestyles (based on online questionnaires, experiments, and social media data) and intervention facilitation (nudge), from which he explores the mechanisms of intervention (cognitive modeling).
