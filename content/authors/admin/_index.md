Hi there, I am Ziqian Xia, a graduate student at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) as well as a primary researcher at [Chao Zhang's Group](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/12413.html).

- I am interested in research on the human and policy dimensions of climate change. Currently I am trying to understand climate change mitigation / adaptation behavior using IoT-based and remote sensing techniques. See [my full publication list](https://ziqian-xia.tech/publist/) for detail.

- I am using MRP and MIRO to conduct large-scale surveys of Chinese individuals, estimating their climate change perceptions and individual carbon footprint. 

Prior to joining [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/), I had my academic training at [Xi Tian's Group](http://sem.ncu.edu.cn/szdw/gccrc/gccrcjxssqjhljrc/799a668ea7be430c9edb199b04109392.htm).

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position, please feel free to contact me.**
