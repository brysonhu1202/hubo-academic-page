abstract: "Objectives: The dataset was collected to provide a comprehensive overview of service utilization, socio-economic conditions, and rehabilitation needs among registered persons with disabilities in Changchun, China. It aims to address the lack of large-scale, individual-level data in this field and to support research on disability inclusion, welfare systems, and social policy development. Data description: The dataset contains records for 197,302 registered persons with disabilities gathered in 2020 via telephone interviews supplemented by in-person visits. It comprises 155 variables across seven domains: demographics; economic conditions; internet access and use; employment and skills; medical and rehabilitation services and assistive products and technology; accessible environment; and cultural and sports participation. Anonymized data, raw tables, and a detailed codebook are openly available on Harvard Dataverse [15]. The resource enables fine-grained analyses of urban–rural and district heterogeneity, functional-limitation patterns, and gaps between required and received services. It also supports the construction of equity-sensitive indicators, multivariable and multilevel models of service utilization, and benchmarking for programmed monitoring. The cross-sectional design and a focus on certificate holders should be considered when interpreting results, yet the scale and coverage make the dataset valuable for comparative studies and careful linkage with public statistics under appropriate safeguards."
