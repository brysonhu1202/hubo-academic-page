abstract: The negative impact of fake news involves not only personal perception and decision-making but also various aspects of society, such as public opinion, the economy, politics, etc. Improving individualsâ€™ ability to discern fake news can reduce its harmful effects while enhancing media literacy is an effective way to better deal with it. However, previous research on media literacy interventions in improving fake news discernment has not yielded consistent results. This study systematically collected 33 independent studies and used meta-analysis to examine the effect of media literacy interventions in enhancing fake news discernment (n=36,256). Results showed that media literacy interventions significantly improved fake news discernment (d=0.53, 95%CI [0.28, 0.78]). Interventions were more effective in the course, game, and video intervention forms, and participants were older adults. In contrast, intervention location and measuring time did not influence the intervention effect.
