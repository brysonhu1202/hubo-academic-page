abstract: "Misinformation affects various aspects of people’s lives, such as politics, entertainment, and social interactions. However, effective intervention measures to combat misinformation are lacking. The inoculation theory has become a prevalent measure of misinformation. This study employed inoculation theory and developed an interactive game to help the public counter misinformation. In this game, players take on the role of the misinformation spreader, intending to add more followers to their virtual accounts using different strategies. A total of 180 Chinese participants were randomly assigned to game-based inoculation, graphic-based inoculation, and control groups. The results indicated that both types of inoculation interventions significantly decreased the perceived credibility and sharing intention of misinformation. Game-based inoculation was more effective than graphic-based inoculation in terms of misinformation perceived credibility, and the intervention effects were stable after 2 weeks. The graphic-based inoculation contained the sleeper effect, which interventions required a period of time to take effect. Neither inoculation produced countereffects on perceived credibility and nor sharing intention of accurate information."

summary: Misinformation has become a severe social problem, and helping the public deal with it is a significant focus of psychologists’ research. One effective approach has been to use psychological inoculation to combat misinformation. Still, the comparative effectiveness of different forms of inoculation and their impact on the perception of accurate information needs further investigation. In this study conducted in China, we compared the effects of game-based and graphic-based forms of inoculation and analyzed their impact on the perception of accurate information and misinformation. We found that both forms of inoculation effectively reduced perceived credibility and sharing intention of misinformation, and the effects remained stable for two weeks. The game-based inoculation was more effective in reducing perceived credibility of misinformation than graphic-based inoculation. Neither form of inoculation impacted the perceived credibility and sharing intention of accurate information. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of inoculation in combating misinformation and suggest that more active inoculation measures should be developed and applied."
