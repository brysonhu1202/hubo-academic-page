	abstract = {Teacher noticing is essential for students’ achievement and teachers’ effective instruction, leading to numerous interventions being designed to strengthen it. However, the evidence about teacher noticing interventions has not yet been systematically consolidated. This study synthesizes 77 effect sizes from 37 studies (2000–2023) that evaluated interventions aimed at improving teacher noticing. The results revealed that the interventions produced a significant positive impact, with an overall effect size of g = 0.70. Disciplinary background and intervention duration moderated the effect sizes. Findings indicate that interventions effectively enhance teacher noticing, and support the adoption of discipline-specific intervention designs with reasonable duration.},
